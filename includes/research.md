* be persistent (get back up and continue when things don't work out as planned -- true research rarely works out as planned)
* be fearless (e.g., be ok hacking a virtual machine, a compiler, a kernel, or implementing a complex algorithm)
* have a small child's attitude (to want to understand and learn about everything they encounter)
* have an engineer's attitude (not to take the first solution that comes to mind, but to look at the key alternatives)
* have a researcher's attitude (to want to truly understand something, and to not be satisfied with the first best explanation)
* want to look at the simple and obvious before exploring the complicated
* be able to focus (to ignore the many other cool things one could also do)
* derive pleasure from coming up with a logical and clear argument or explanation
* like to read (books, papers, papers, papers)

# R&D Activities
* from February 2007 to February 2009, I participate to a "FACEPE" project (a two year program with the University of Pernambouco, Brazil) called <b>SIntArch</b> (Safe Introduction of Interaction patterns in Component Based Software Architectures) between Pr Augusto Cesar Alvez Sampaio and the Triskell group on Component Based Software Architecture design using : Model-driven engineering and Aspects Oriented Modeling. In 2008, we have consolidated the model-snippet MDK used in Kermeta.
* from 2008 to 2011, I participate to the **[STREP FP7 Diva project](http://www.diva-project.eu/)** (<b>Dynamic Variability In Complex, Adaptive Systems</b>). The goal of DiVA is to provide a tool-supported methodology for managing dynamic variability of co-existing, co-dependent configurations in adaptive systems that span system administration and platform boundaries. Examples of such adaptive systems are communication infrastructure in rescue operations and mobile entertainment environments. This is addressed through a combination of aspect-oriented and model-driven techniques. DiVA explores how adaptation policies can be captured in the requirements, how aspects can model the variants used to adapt the system, how models can be kept at runtime to drive the adaptation and which validation techniques have to be developed in this context.
* from 2008 to 2011, I participate to the <b>[Mopcom Ingénierie project](http://mopcom-i.gforge.inria.fr/)</b>. <b>Mopcom-I</b> is a project of the Competitivity Cluster “Images & réseaux” of Brittany. The project focuses on the use of model driven engineering for the development of Software for Image domain. The project will produce a complete methodology and development environment dedicated to the domain.
* from 2008 to 2011, I participate to the <b>[ANR Movida project](http://movida.gforge.inria.fr/)</b>. The goal of <b>MOVIDA</b> is to provide a solution for modeling view in system engineering and to provide decision support for architects. Today, and likely for a long time to come, the complexity of software dominant systems is still growing and the variety of system classes tends to expand. From embedded systems which are required to cope with spare resources, to system of systems for which the evolvability and flexibility is key, requirements classes are expanding. In addition new concerns or more stringent existing concerns bring their extra complexity. They are environmental concerns, maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) concerns, supply management concerns etc. All of them play today an active or even sometime decisive role in the engineering decision process. The difficulty to embrace the whole complexity of the concerns and the difficulty to manage their inter-relations has raised the interest of the engineering community for "concerns driven" engineering. This is addressed today in the model driven engineering research community through the exploration of "viewpoint modelling" technologies. The aim of the MOVIDA project is to provide a support to model-driven viewpoint engineering through:
	* Defining and specifying the underlying concepts that must be shared and used when implementing an engineering solution supporting viewpoint management.
	* Providing a support to the definition of specific viewpoints, enabling their composition in a consistent whole that fits a specific project needs.
	* Managing the consistency of an information bulk made of several views on a system which is accessed, modified and managed by different stakeholders during the system definition process.
	* Applying decision-support tools to multi-viewpoint modeling frameworks so as to support architectural trade-offs.
* from 2008 to 2012, I participate to the <b>[S-Cube Network of Excellence](http://www.s-cube-network.eu/)</b>. <b>S-Cube</b>, the Software Services and Systems Network, aims establishing an integrated, multidisciplinary, vibrant research community which will enable Europe to lead the software-services revolution, thereby helping shape the software-service based Internet which is the backbone of our future interactive society.
* from 2009 to 2011, I participate to the <b>[DAUM ADT](http://www.irisa.fr/myriads/collaborate/national/adt/daum/)</b>. <b>DAUM</b> aims at providing an integrated platform for distributed dynamically adaptable component based applications. DAUM unites and integrates results and software from the Triskell EPI and the Myriads team. More precisely, DAUM extends the Kevoree component framework designed by Triskell with adaptation mechanisms from the SAFDIS framework designed by Myriads Team.
* Since 2011, I manage with Benoit Combemale, <b>[VaryMDE](http://varymde.gforge.inria.fr/)</b>,  a bilateral collaboration (2011 - 2015) between our team at Inria and the MDE lab at Thales Research & Technology (TRT). This partnership explores variability management issues at both the modeling level and the metamodeling level (i.e., design and implementation of software language).
* Since 2012, I participate the the <b>[ITEA Merge project](http://www.merge-project.eu/)</b>. The ITEA 2 project MERgE, aims to develop and demonstrate innovative concepts and design tools to address multi-concerns interactions in systems, targeting the elaboration of effective architectural solutions with a focus on safety and security.
* Since 2012, I participate to the <b>[ANR Gemoc  project](http://gemoc.org/)</b> leaded by my colleague [Benoit Combemale](http://people.irisa.fr/Benoit.Combemale/). The ANR Project <b>GEMOC</b> (French Agency for Research, grant ANR-12-INSE-0011) focuses on a generic framework for heterogeneous software model execution and dynamic analysis. This work has the ambition to propose an innovative environment for the design of complex software-intensive systems.
* Since 2012, I participate to the ANR <b>[InfraJVM project](http://infrajvm.irisa.fr/)</b>. The <b>Infra-JVM</b> project investigates how to enhance the design of Java virtual machines  with new functionalities to better manage resources. 
* Since 2013, I participate to the <b>[FET Diversify project](http://diversify-project.eu/)</b> leaded by my colleague [Benoit Baudry](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Benoit.Baudry/). <b>DIVERSIFY</b> explores diversity as the foundation for a novel software design principle and increased adaptive capacities in collaborative adaptive systems.
* Since 2013, I work on the european project <b>[HEADS](http://heads-project.eu/)</b> as a WP4 leader. The idea of the <b>HEADS</b> project is to leverage model-driven software engineering and generative programming techniques to provide a new integrated software engineering approach which allow advanced exploitation the full range of diversity and specificity of the future computing continuum.
* Since 2013, I work at the <b>[B-COM IRT](http://b-com.com/)</b> in the <b>INDEED</b> project. 
* Since September 2014, I will work on the <b>Clarity</b> project leaded by Obeo.
